                                user-specific settings.</li>
                            <li><strong>Guild (Server) IDs:</strong> To identify servers and store server-specific
                                settings (e.g., prefix, welcome messages).</li>
                            <li><strong>Channel IDs:</strong> To identify specific channels for features like logging,
                                welcome messages, or command-only channels.</li>
                            <li><strong>Role IDs:</strong> For permission-based commands and auto-role features.</li>
                            <li><strong>Command Usage:</strong> We may log which commands are used and how often to

                            </li>
                            <li><strong>User-Generated Content:</strong> Data generated through bot features, such as
                                user profiles, inventory in the economy system, or experience points in the leveling
                                system.</li>
                        </ul>
    
                        <h4>Information from the Dashboard Website:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Cookies and Session Data:</strong> When you log in to our dashboard, we use
                                secure cookies to keep you authenticated. This data is linked to your Discord profile

                        </ul>
    
                        <h3>2. How We Use Your Information</h3>

                        <ul>
                            <li>To provide, maintain, and improve the core functionality of the Service.</li>
                            <li>To personalize your experience (e.g., showing your level or balance).</li>
                            <li>To provide customer support and respond to your inquiries.</li>
                            <li>To monitor the usage of the Service for performance and security analysis.</li>
                        </ul>
    
                        <h3>3. Data Storage and Security</h3>
                        <p>All data is stored on secure servers. We take reasonable measures to protect your information
                            from unauthorized access, loss, or misuse. However, no internet-based service can be 100%
                            secure.</p>
    
                        <h3>4. Data Retention</h3>
                        <p>We retain data for as long as it is necessary to provide the Service.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Server-specific settings are retained until the bot is removed from the server.</li>
                            <li>User-generated data (like economy balance or levels) is retained until the user is no
                                longer in any server with the bot or requests data deletion.</li>
                            <li>Transient data like command logs may be cleared periodically.</li>
                        </ul>
    
                        <h3>5. Data Sharing</h3>
                        <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personally identifiable information to
                            outside parties. This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our
                            Service (like our hosting provider), so long as those parties agree to keep this information
                            confidential.</p>
    
                        <h3>6. Your Rights</h3>
                        <p>You have the right to request access to or deletion of your personal data. To do so, please
                            contact us through our official support channels.</p>
                        <p>To request data deletion for a server, the server owner must remove the bot from the server.
                            This will automatically trigger the deletion of server-specific configurations.</p>
    
                        <h3>7. Children's Privacy</h3>
                        <p>Our Service does not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children
                            under the age of 13. If you believe we have collected such information, please contact us
                            immediately so we can take appropriate action.</p>
    
                        <h3>8. Changes to This Policy</h3>
                        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by
                            posting the new policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy
                            periodically for any changes.</p>
