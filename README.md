Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

*   **npm:** (usually included with Node.js)
*   **A database:** MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MSSQL

    *   Rename `example.kythia.config.js` to `kythia.config.js`.
    *   Open both files and fill in the required values. The comments will guide you!
4.  **Start the bot:**
    *   For a quick test, run:
        ```bash
        npm start
        ```
    *   For 24/7 hosting, use PM2:
