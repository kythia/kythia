# Privacy Policy

_Last updated: 6 August 2025_

This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and disclose information when you use the Kythia Discord bot and its associated services and website ("Service").

## 1. Information We Collect

We only collect data that is necessary for the Service to function properly. **We do NOT store message content that is unrelated to a command.**

**Information Collected Automatically via Discord:**

- **User IDs:** To identify users for features like economy, leveling, and user-specific settings.
- **Guild (Server) IDs:** To identify servers and store server-specific settings (e.g., prefix, welcome messages).
- **Channel IDs:** To identify specific channels for features like logging, welcome messages, or command-only channels.
- **Role IDs:** For permission-based commands and auto-role features.
- **Command Usage:** We may log which commands are used and how often to improve the Service and identify issues.

**Information You Provide Voluntarily:**

- **Server Configurations:** Any settings a server administrator configures for the bot, such as welcome messages, moderation rules, or enabled/disabled features.
- **User-Generated Content:** Data generated through bot features, such as user profiles, inventory in the economy system, or experience points in the leveling system.

**Information from the Dashboard Website:**

- **Cookies and Session Data:** When you log in to our dashboard, we use secure cookies to keep you authenticated. This data is linked to your Discord profile (ID, username, guilds) as provided by the Discord API during authentication.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use the collected information for the following purposes:

- To provide, maintain, and improve the core functionality of the Service.
- To personalize your experience (e.g., showing your level or balance).
- To provide customer support and respond to your inquiries.
- To monitor the usage of the Service for performance and security analysis.

## 3. Data Storage and Security

All data is stored on secure servers. We take reasonable measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, loss, or misuse. However, no internet-based service can be 100% secure.

## 4. Data Retention

We retain data for as long as it is necessary to provide the Service.

- Server-specific settings are retained until the bot is removed from the server.
- User-generated data (like economy balance or levels) is retained until the user is no longer in any server with the bot or requests data deletion.
- Transient data like command logs may be cleared periodically.

## 5. Data Sharing

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personally identifiable information to outside parties. This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our Service (like our hosting provider), so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential.

## 6. Your Rights

You have the right to request access to or deletion of your personal data. To do so, please contact us through our official support channels.

To request data deletion for a server, the server owner must remove the bot from the server. This will automatically trigger the deletion of server-specific configurations.

## 7. Children's Privacy

Our Service does not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. If you believe we have collected such information, please contact us immediately so we can take appropriate action.

## 8. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.

## 9. Contact Us

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at [me@kenn.my.id](mailto:me@kenn.my.id) or by joining our Support Server.
